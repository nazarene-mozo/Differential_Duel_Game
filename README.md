# Project Title: Turn-Based Differential Duel Game Made in Python

## 1. Project Description:

Differential Duel is a turn-based educational and action-packed 2D fighting game powered by Python and basic calculus properties. Players input mathematical functions to attack opponents, and a derivative graph of each function is drawn during the attack using turtle. The more complex your equation, the more attack damage you do.


## 2. Tech Stack:

- Python 3.8+
- Pygame (Downloadable)
- Turtle (built-in module)
- Sympy (Downloadable)

URL: [https://www.pygame.org/news ](https://www.pygame.org/news)

In cmd, check 
```
pip install sympy
```


## 3. Installing:

1. Clone the git repo (optional)

```
https://github.com/nazarene-mozo/Differential_Duel_Game
```

1. Install files from the Google Drive

```
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BOyZLIPuTAYARAQwh6KQ59-9bwdTDiJG?usp=sharing 
```

2. Open project folder

3. Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your PC.

4. Then install the required Python libraries:

5. Open main.py and run

6. Play the game

7. If there are missing modules, refer to 3. and download pygame / python

Enjoy!


## 4. How to Play:

1. Input a valid function of x (e.g., x^2 + 3x, sin(x), log(x)).

2. Your function must include the variable x.

3. Upon pressing Enter, if the input is valid:

- Your fighter attacks!

- The derivative graph of your function is displayed using a turtle window.

4. Damage is calculated based on function complexity.

5. Enemy fights back automatically.


## 5. Screen Recording:


## 6. Tips to Play:

1. Use different valid functions each round (repetition is not allowed).

2. Try combining multiple math functions for greater effect (e.g., x^2 * sin(x)).

3. Valid functions include: sin, cos, tan, log, ln, sqrt, abs, exp.


## 7. Educational Value / Ethics:

This game reinforces mathematical creativity and intuition by encouraging users to build valid and complex equations for strategic gameplay. This game is for educational and non-commercial purposes. Modify and share freely with proper credit.
