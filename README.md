# Differential_Duel_Game
Differential Duel is a turn-based educational and action-packed 2D fighting game powered by Python and basic calculus properties. Players input mathematical functions to attack opponents, and a derivative graph of each function is drawn during the attack using turtle. The more complex your equation, the more attack damage you do.
